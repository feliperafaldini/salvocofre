Creates timestamped ZIP backups of the database and site files, restores the database and can run on a schedule.

== Description ==

Salvocofre Backup creates a ZIP archive with the site files and a SQL dump of the database, keeps the previous backups under a retention limit, and can restore the database from any complete archive. It works on a single WordPress installation; multisite is not supported.

Each backup is a set of two files in `wp-content/salvocofre-backups/`:

* `salvocofre-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip` — the SQL dump plus every readable file in the WordPress installation.
* `salvocofre-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql` — the same database dump on its own.

Names use the site time zone and are never reused: if two runs start in the same second, the second one gets a `-2` suffix. A new backup never overwrites an older one; old sets are removed only by the retention limit or by hand.

**The database dump**

* Starts with the site URL, the UTC date, `SET SESSION sql_mode = ''` and `SET NAMES` with the database charset and collation.
* Disables foreign key checks and opens a consistent snapshot before reading the tables.
* Writes `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` and `CREATE TABLE` for every table, followed by one `INSERT` per row.
* Ends with `COMMIT` and re-enables foreign key checks.
* Checks `$wpdb->last_error` after every query, so a missing table or a failed read stops the backup instead of producing a partial file.
* Writes binary or non-UTF-8 values as hexadecimal literals.
* Includes every table in the current database, including tables created by other plugins.
* Does not include views, triggers, stored procedures or events.

**The ZIP archive**

* Contains the SQL dump at the archive root and the site files under their original relative paths.
* Excludes the backup directory itself, `wp-content/cache` and `wp-content/upgrade`.
* Includes `wp-config.php`, so treat the archive as sensitive data.
* If a file cannot be added, the run fails and the partial archive is removed.

**Managing backups**

The top-level **Salvocofre** menu opens the **Backups** screen. The table shows the date, the file names, the total size and the actions for every backup set:

* **Download (.zip)** and **Download (.sql)** stream one file through `admin-post.php`; the link carries a nonce and the path is rebuilt from the requested backup name.
* **Delete** removes both files of the set. It is a POST request with a nonce tied to that set, so a stale link cannot delete another backup.
* A set with only one file is marked **Incomplete** and is kept until it is deleted by hand. Retention never removes it.

The dashboard widget shows the latest backup, the number of sets and the total size on disk, with a link to the full screen and a **Backup now** button. The **Backups** screen also has a **Backup now** button.

**Restoring the database**

**Tools > Salvocofre Restore** restores the database from the `.zip` archive of a backup set. The screen shows a restore form only for sets whose ZIP exists and is not empty.

1. Type the exact backup name to confirm the operation.
2. The plugin creates a full safety backup first. If that backup fails, the restore is aborted.
3. The archive is extracted to a temporary directory outside the web root. Entries with absolute paths, `..` references, null bytes or symbolic links are rejected before any archive entry is written, and archives with more than 50,000 entries are refused by default.
4. Only the SQL dump is executed. The site files in the archive are validated and then discarded; the files of the installation are not changed.
5. The restore routine does not delete the backup it used, and the safety backup is kept too. Both count toward the retention limit. The object cache is flushed when the process finishes.

A failing `SET` statement is logged and skipped, because restricted database users may not be allowed to change every session value. Any other failing statement stops the restore and shows the error, so a restore can leave the database partially restored. You may need to sign in again after the database changes.

The restore screen cannot restore a `.sql` file on its own, and it does not restore site files. To recover files, extract the ZIP over the WordPress directory manually.

**Automatic backups**

**Settings > Salvocofre Backup** controls scheduled backups:

* The schedule is enabled by default with a daily frequency after activation.
* Frequencies: hourly, twice daily, daily and weekly.
* Changing the frequency replaces the existing event; it never creates a second event.
* The same screen shows the last scheduled run, its result and the next due time, and warns when the event is overdue, missing or when `DISABLE_WP_CRON` is set.
* A lock prevents two backups from running at the same time, whether they are scheduled or started by hand. A lock older than 15 minutes is treated as abandoned and can be taken over.

WP-Cron only runs when the site receives traffic. A quiet site can therefore run an automatic backup late. To keep the schedule on time, disable WP-Cron and call `wp-cron.php` from a system cron job.

The status e-mail is sent for manual backups started from the admin screens: a failure is reported whenever the administrator address is valid, and a success is reported only when the `salvocofre_email_on_success` option is enabled (there is no setting for it in the admin screens yet). The message goes to the site administrator address and can be redirected with the `salvocofre_status_email_recipient` filter. A failed scheduled run is recorded in the settings status and in the site log, but it does not send an e-mail.

**Retention**

The **Backups to keep** setting defaults to 5 and accepts 0 to 50. Zero keeps every backup. The limit is applied after every successful backup, manual or scheduled, and only complete sets count. Sets left incomplete by an interrupted run stay on disk until they are deleted.

**Pre-flight checks**

Before writing any file, the plugin estimates the database size from `information_schema` (cached for 10 minutes) and checks three limits:

* Memory: a fixed floor of 64 MB. The dump is streamed to disk in chunks, so the requirement does not grow with the database.
* Disk: about twice the database size plus 16 MB against the free space of the backup directory.
* Time: about five seconds plus one second per 2 MB against `max_execution_time`.

A backup that would exceed a known limit is stopped with an explanatory error before the dump starts. When PHP does not expose a limit, that check is skipped.

**The backup directory**

The plugin creates `wp-content/salvocofre-backups/` on activation and on every admin request if it is missing. The directory receives an `.htaccess` file that denies direct access and an empty `index.php`. Define `SALVOCOFRE_BACKUP_DIR` in `wp-config.php` before the plugin loads to use another absolute path.

Downloads do not rely on direct access to that directory: they are served by `admin-post.php` after the capability and nonce checks.

**Who can run a backup**

Users with the `manage_options` capability by default. The capability can be changed with the `salvocofre_backup_capability` filter.

**Uninstall**

Deactivation removes the scheduled event and any run lock; the backups are left untouched. Uninstall removes every plugin option and the run lock, so nothing is left in the database. The backup directory is kept unless the site owner has enabled the `salvocofre_delete_backups_on_uninstall` option; when enabled, the directory is removed as well.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `salvocofre` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install `salvocofre-<version>.zip` through **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**. The `salvocofre.zip` archive, with the plugin files at its root, is meant for SVN trunk and is not the file the upload screen expects.
2. Activate the plugin on the **Plugins** screen. Activation creates and protects `wp-content/salvocofre-backups/` and schedules the first automatic backup.
3. Open the **Dashboard** or the **Salvocofre** menu to create a backup. The **Backups** screen lists, downloads and deletes backup sets.
4. Open **Settings > Salvocofre Backup** to enable or disable automatic backups, choose the frequency and set the retention limit.
5. Use **Tools > Salvocofre Restore** to restore the database from a complete `.zip` backup.

The web server user must be able to write to `wp-content/`. For backups, the database user must be allowed to run `SHOW TABLES`, `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, `SELECT` and to read `information_schema`. For a restore, it also needs permission to run `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT`, because the dump recreates the tables it contains.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the backup files stored? =

In `wp-content/salvocofre-backups/` by default. The directory is created by the plugin and protected with `.htaccess` on Apache. Define `SALVOCOFRE_BACKUP_DIR` in `wp-config.php` to use another absolute path.

= Does the plugin send any data outside my site? =

No. It makes no HTTP requests, sends no telemetry and does not contact WordPress.org or any other service. The only outgoing message is the status e-mail, delivered through your own site's mail configuration to the administrator address. Backups, settings and logs stay on your server.

= How many backups are kept? =

Five by default. Change **Backups to keep** under **Settings > Salvocofre Backup**: 0 keeps every backup and the maximum is 50. The limit is applied after each successful backup.

= Are old backups overwritten? =

No. Every run creates a new timestamped set. Sets beyond the retention limit are deleted after a successful backup.

= Can visitors download the backup? =

On Apache the `.htaccess` file denies all requests to the directory. On nginx `.htaccess` is ignored: add a server rule such as `location ~* /wp-content/salvocofre-backups/ { deny all; }`, or define `SALVOCOFRE_BACKUP_DIR` in `wp-config.php` to a directory outside the web root. The admin download links require a logged-in user with the backup capability and a valid nonce.

= Does the plugin work on multisite? =

No. It has only been tested on a single site. On a multisite network it dumps every table in the network database and every file in the installation, without any per-site separation.

= Does it restore my site? =

It restores the database from a `.zip` backup. Site files are not restored: the archive is validated, its dump is executed and the extracted files are discarded. To recover files, extract the ZIP over the WordPress directory with the site offline.

= Does restoring delete the backup? =

No. The restore routine does not delete the backup, and the safety backup created before the restore is kept as well. Both count toward the retention limit.

= What happens if a restore fails? =

A failing `SET` statement is logged and skipped. Any other failing statement stops the restore and the screen shows the error. Because the dump recreates tables one by one, the database can be left partially restored. Use the safety backup to try again.

= Why did the backup fail? =

The usual causes are a missing `ZipArchive` extension, a database error, a full disk, or a PHP memory or time limit. The pre-flight checks stop the run before writing when they can predict the problem. The error is written to `wp-content/debug.log` when `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` are enabled. A manual run also sends a failure e-mail to the administrator address.

= Why did the scheduled backup not run? =

WP-Cron only runs when the site receives a request. A quiet site can be late. Check the next due time under **Settings > Salvocofre Backup**; if `DISABLE_WP_CRON` is set, call `wp-cron.php` from a system cron job.

= Does the archive include uploads and other plugins? =

Yes. Every readable file under the WordPress installation is added, except the backup directory, `wp-content/cache` and `wp-content/upgrade`.

= Are backups from version 0.1.0 listed? =

No. Version 0.1.0 used the fixed names `salvocofre.sql` and `salvocofre.zip`. Those files are not matched by the timestamped names, so they are neither listed nor removed by retention. Download or delete them manually before upgrading if you need them.

= Can I change who is allowed to run backups? =

Yes. Use the `salvocofre_backup_capability` filter and return another capability, for example `manage_network_options` or a custom capability.

= Does uninstalling delete my backups? =

By default, no. Uninstall removes every plugin option and keeps the backup files. Backups are deleted only when the `salvocofre_delete_backups_on_uninstall` option is enabled before uninstalling. There is no setting for this option in the admin screens yet.

= Can I extend the plugin? =

Yes. The plugin exposes actions and filters so another plugin can react to a backup or change its behaviour without touching the code.

Actions: `salvocofre_backup_started`, `salvocofre_backup_completed` (receives the new set), `salvocofre_backup_failed` (receives the `WP_Error`), `salvocofre_backup_deleted`, `salvocofre_retention_deleted` and `salvocofre_restore_completed`.

Filters: `salvocofre_backup_dir`, `salvocofre_backup_capability`, `salvocofre_backup_excluded_paths`, `salvocofre_dump_tables`, `salvocofre_dump_chunk_size`, `salvocofre_dump_insert_batch`, `salvocofre_required_memory_bytes`, `salvocofre_cron_enabled`, `salvocofre_cron_frequencies`, `salvocofre_cron_lock_timeout`, `salvocofre_restore_read_chunk`, `salvocofre_restore_max_entries` and `salvocofre_status_email_recipient`.

Every hook is documented in the source, next to where it fires.

= Is the archive sensitive? =

Yes. The ZIP contains `wp-config.php` and the database dump, including password hashes and personal data. Keep it private.

== Screenshots ==

1. The **Backups** screen with the table of sets, the download and delete actions, and the total size on disk.
2. The **Salvocofre Restore** screen under **Tools**, with the warning, the backup table and the typed confirmation field.
3. The **Salvocofre Backup** settings screen with the schedule status, the frequency selector and the retention field.
4. The **Backups** screen right after a run, with the success notice and the new set at the top of the table.
5. The **Backups** screen after a failed run, with the notice naming the limit that stopped the backup.

== Limitations ==

These limits are known and accepted for version 0.2.0:

* **Database size.** Tested with a table of 150,000 rows: a 37.8 MB dump and a 42 MB archive in 8 seconds, with a peak of 42 MB of memory under a 128 MB limit. The dump is written to disk in chunks of 500 rows and the restore reads it back in 64 KB blocks, so memory stays flat. The remaining limit is time, not memory (see below).
* **Request time.** Manual and scheduled backups run inside a request. A small site takes about 9 seconds; the 150,000-row test took 8 seconds to back up and 19 seconds to restore. Under Apache the default limit is 30 seconds, so a database several times larger than the test will hit the timeout. There is no background processing yet.
* **WP-Cron depends on traffic.** Automatic backups only start when WordPress receives a request or when `wp-cron.php` is called by a system cron job. A quiet site can run a backup late.
* **Apache dependency.** Directory protection relies on `.htaccess`. On nginx or another server that ignores `.htaccess`, you must add your own rule or move the directory outside the web root with `SALVOCOFRE_BACKUP_DIR`.
* **Multisite.** Not supported. See the FAQ above.
* **Restore scope.** Only the database is restored. The site files in the archive are not written to the installation. A restore that fails halfway can leave the database partially restored.
* **Restore input.** Only backups with a non-empty `.zip` archive can be restored from the screen. A `.sql` file on its own cannot be restored there, and extraction needs a temporary directory outside the web root.
* **ZipArchive.** The PHP `zip` extension is required. Without it, backups and restores fail with an error.
* **Database objects.** Views, triggers, stored procedures and events are not included in the dump.
* **Retention and incomplete sets.** Retention only deletes complete sets; a set with one missing file stays until it is deleted by hand.
* **Concurrent runs.** A second backup started while one is running is refused with a warning instead of running in parallel. The refusal is not queued: you have to try again after the first run finishes.
* **Sensitive archive.** The ZIP contains `wp-config.php` and the database dump, including password hashes and personal data. Keep it private.

== Roadmap ==

Multisite support, restoring site files, background processing for large sites and dumping database objects such as views and triggers are not part of version 0.2.1. No release date is promised.
